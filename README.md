Application to map the local bars in Winona, MN

This was a personal project with some friends that died out. Hope to continue it in the future. 

Idea was to create a app that the local Winona bars could be on to give a list of current specials, and music nights. 
I used googles platform FireBase for the first time and would like to explore further.
